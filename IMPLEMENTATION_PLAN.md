# AER Flow — Implementation Plan

The behavioral spec (`spec/aer-flow-behavioral-spec-v1.0.md`) is authoritative for what the system must guarantee. This document is authoritative for how we are getting there: which subsystems exist, how they group into milestones, and — for the current milestone — what the phase breakdown is.

**Session prompt:** The behavioral spec is authoritative. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is authoritative for sequencing. Help implement the current phase only.

## Capability Map

What subsystems exist, derived from the spec. Not chronological — this is architecture, not a build order.

| # | Subsystem | Spec reference |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Log Manager** | Atomic append to `flow.jsonl`; fsync write-before-dispatch ordering | §5, §7 |
| 2 | **State Projector** | `Project(EventStore, Snapshot) → FlowState`; causal linking by `ExecutionId` | §12, §13 |
| 3 | **Template Parser** | Load and validate `WorkflowDefinition` from file | §11.1 |
| 4 | **Snapshot Binder** | Freeze template into immutable `WorkflowDefinitionSnapshot` at task creation | §11.2 |
| 5 | **Dependency Resolver** | §11.3 readiness check: condition 1 (dependency succeeded) + condition 2 (staleness via `UpstreamExecutionIds`) | §11.3 |
| 6 | **Artifact Manager** | Pre-allocate `artifacts/execution_{N}/`; assign immutable input/output paths before dispatch | §16 |
| 7 | **Core Dispatcher** | Emit `ExecutionRequest` to aer-core M5 binding; receive `AerEvent` callbacks | §3, §12 |
| 8 | **Outcome Classifier** | Map Core exit reason + output existence to `ExecutionSucceeded/Failed/Cancelled` | §8 |
| 9 | **Contract Validator** | Assert all `ProducedOutputs` exist on disk before classifying as succeeded | §8 |
| 10 | **Retry Engine** | On `ExecutionFailed`, generate new `ExecutionRequest` with new `ExecutionId` per `RetryPolicy` | §10 |
| 11 | **Mutation Interface** | Single entry point for all external state changes; no other mutation path exists | §14 |
| 12 | **Concurrency Guard** | At most one writer per task namespace; file lock (not sentinel file) | §15 |
| 13 | **Pause Engine** | `PausePoint` handling; emit `WorkflowPaused`; idle until decision arrives | §17.1 |
| 14 | **External Decision Handler** | `ExternalDecisionRecorded`; `Resume/Reject/RetryWithRevision/Supersede` | §17.2 |
| 15 | **Supersede + Invalidation Cascade** | New execution for superseded step; staleness propagates forward via §11.3 condition 2 automatically | §17.5 |
| 16 | **Human Worker Support** | Non-process `ExecutionRequest`; completion detected by file existence, not Core exit | §17.3 |

## Milestone Roadmap

Which milestone introduces which capabilities.

| Milestone | Capabilities introduced | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|
| **M7: Foundation** | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 | aer-core M5 |
| **M8: Reactive Scheduler** | 10 (Retry Engine); full fan-out/fan-in DAG testing; manifest cache if scale demands | M7 |
| **M9: External Decisions** | 13, 14, 15, 16 (all pause/decision/supersede/human machinery) | M8 |
| **M10: Cancellation & Edge Cases** | §9 cancellation flow; crash recovery hardening (§7 full robustness) | M9 |

---

## Current Milestone

**M10: Cancellation & Edge Cases** — no phase plan yet. Per the Milestone Roadmap: §9's
cancellation flow and full §7 crash-recovery hardening, blocked by M9 (now complete). Needs its
own phase-plan doc (a dedicated docs PR, per M8's and M9's own precedent) before implementation starts.

## Completed Milestones

Completed milestones keep only their phase checklist and any decisions of record later work
still leans on. The full phase plans — goals, boundaries, and the open questions each phase
resolved — live in this file's git history and in the linked issues.

**M9: External Decisions** — pause a workflow at a `PausePoint`, record each of the four external
decision types through the single mutation surface, and drive their consequences to a fixed point,
including the automatic invalidation cascade and the human (non-process) worker tier.

- ✅ Phase 1 — Pause Engine (#57)
- ✅ Phase 2 — External Decision Handler: record, validate, Resume/Reject (#58)
- ✅ Phase 3 — RetryWithRevision + Supersede + the invalidation cascade (#59)
- ✅ Phase 4 — Human worker support (#60)
- ✅ Phase 5 — Pause/decision/supersede/human end-to-end integration tests (#61)

Decisions of record from M9:

- **Pause is a derived obligation, not dispatch-continuation state**: `PauseEngine.GetPauseObligations`
  is re-evaluated from projected `FlowState` at the top of every scheduling round, exactly like
  M8's retry-aware readiness — a crash between a settled outcome and its `WorkflowPaused` append
  re-derives the identical obligation on the next pump call (Phase 1).
- **§10 runs before §17.1**: a `PausePoint` step's failure retries per `RetryPolicy` first;
  `WorkflowPaused` only follows a *settled* round (`Succeeded`, `Cancelled`, or `Failed` with
  `MayRetry` false) — otherwise `RetryPolicy` would be unreachable on any pause-point step (Phase 1).
- **One resolving decision per pause**: each recorded decision immediately clears the referenced
  execution's `Paused` status via `WorkflowResumed`; a further decision naming the same execution
  fails validation. Supplementary executions (§17.3) are not decisions and don't occupy this slot
  (Phase 2).
- **`Reject` reaches even a successful paused outcome**: unlike ordinary retry exhaustion,
  `Reject` forecloses retry regardless of remaining budget and projects `StepStatus.Rejected` —
  the approval-gate "no" (Phase 2).
- **Decision consequences are projected facts, not handler state**: `PendingSupplementaryExecutionId`
  and `IsPendingSupersedeTarget` are derived from the log on every pump call, so a crash between
  `RecordDecisionAsync` recording a decision and the pump dispatching its consequence loses nothing —
  proved directly by Phase 5's crash-window-style re-invocation cases (Phase 3).
- **The supplementary artifact reaches a worker via `AER_SUPPLEMENTARY_INPUT`**, a dedicated
  environment variable alongside `AER_INPUT_<n>`, so it can never collide with a declared input
  name (Phase 3).
- **An unsatisfied non-process contract means still pending, never `Failed`**: there is no exit
  signal to classify against, so `NonProcessCompletionDetector` only ever appends
  `ExecutionSucceeded`, consulted fresh at the top of every round exactly like the Pause Engine's
  obligation (Phase 4).
- **A step-less supplementary execution never perturbs step projection**: `ExecutionRequest.StepId`
  is optional; `StateProjector` tracks step-less executions in `FlowState.StepLessExecutions` and
  ignores them for `StepState` entirely, so minting one during a pause changes nothing about the
  paused step's own status (Phase 4).
- **A pause-point step re-pauses on every settled round, including a successful retry or
  supersede rerun**: `PauseRecordedForLatestExecution` is keyed to the *latest* `ExecutionId`, so
  a fresh attempt has never itself been paused — `RetryWithRevision`/`Supersede` consequences
  need their own follow-up `Resume` before downstream work depending on `Succeeded` can proceed,
  confirmed against real processes in Phase 5.

**M8: Reactive Scheduler** — fan-out/fan-in DAG with retries and concurrent dispatch.

- ✅ Phase 1 — Attempt-history projection (#45)
- ✅ Phase 2 — Retry Engine + retry-aware readiness (#46)
- ✅ Phase 3 — Reactive concurrent dispatch (#47)
- ✅ Phase 4 — Fan-out/fan-in + retry end-to-end integration tests (#48)

Decisions of record from M8:

- **Attempt counting is per round**: `ConsecutiveFailureCount` counts trailing consecutive failures *since the last success*, so a step re-run after M9's `Supersede` starts with a fresh retry budget — matching §11.3's "only the latest attempt per step matters" framing (Phase 1).
- **Retry decisions live in `Aer.Flow.Scheduling.RetryEngine`**, a pure predicate (`MayRetry`) consulted by the Dependency Resolver; "terminally failed" is a derived fact (`Failed` ∧ ¬`MayRetry`), never a stored event, per §5.2. `Cancelled` is never retried (§9, §10); `MaxAttempts` is total attempts per round and validated `>= 1` (Phase 2).
- **Determinism under concurrency (§13)**: `ExecutionRequestAccepted` events are appended and fsync'd sequentially in snapshot declaration order *before* their dispatches are awaited; completion order only influences *when* the next projection happens, never *what* it concludes (Phase 3).
- **No concurrency cap in M8**, recorded deliberately: `ExecutionRequestRejected` stays unexercised until an admission cap is a real, scoped design decision (rejection is durable; what re-admits a rejected step?) (Phase 3).
- **Manifest cache deferred** per §21's expectation: a 400-event log re-reads in ~3.8ms, dwarfed by real dispatch latency; revisit only if a per-task log grows large enough for this to show up in practice (Phase 4).

**M7: Foundation** — linear A → B → C end-to-end, happy path only.

- ✅ Phase 1 — Domain model (#7)
- ✅ Phase 2 — Log Manager (#8)
- ✅ Phase 3 — Template Parser + Snapshot Binder (#9)
- ✅ Phase 4 — State Projector (#10)
- ✅ Phase 5 — Dependency Resolver (#11)
- ✅ Phase 6 — Artifact Manager + Core Dispatcher (#12)
- ✅ Phase 7 — Outcome Classifier + Contract Validator + Mutation Interface (#13)
- ✅ Phase 8 — Concurrency Guard + end-to-end integration test (#14)

Decisions of record from M7:

- **Workflow definition files are plain JSON** (`.json`, one document — not `.jsonl`), deserialized through the same `System.Text.Json` converters as every other domain record and `flow.jsonl` itself (Phase 3).
- **Paths reach workers via environment variables**: `AER_INPUT_<n>` and `AER_OUTPUT_DIR`. `ArtifactManager.ResolveInputPaths` matches a step's declared `Inputs` names against its direct dependencies' declared `Outputs` names (Phase 6).
- **A single `flow.jsonl` records both Flow- and Core-originated events** (allowed because §5 leaves the storage backend implementation-defined); §5.1's dual-log ownership is enforced in the type system (`LogEntry.FlowLogEntry` vs. `LogEntry.CoreLogEntry`), not by physical file separation (Phase 6).
- **aer-core is consumed as a pinned git submodule** (`external/aer-core`), built from source via `pixi run build-core`. Revisit with a real package feed only once a second consumer exists (Phase 6; AER Overview §6).
- **Worker resolution shape**: the Mutation Interface takes `Worker`-name → `WorkerBinding` (the `WorkerContract`, the concrete `CoreDispatchTarget`, and a per-worker `Timeout`). The timeout deliberately lives on the binding, not the step, keeping the frozen `WorkflowDefinitionSnapshot` shape (§11.2) unchanged (Phase 7).
- **Where `FailureClassification` (§8.1) lives**: the first of the contract's declared `OptionalMetadata` file names (checked in order) that exists in the output directory, parses as JSON, and has a top-level `FailureClassification` field wins; absent or unrecognized is `null`, which every consumer treats as `Retryable` (Phase 7).
- **The concurrency guard is held by the Mutation Interface** for the full duration of the mutation call — the single mutation surface (§14) is the one place §15's guarantee needs enforcing. `flow.lock` is left on disk on release; its existence is deliberately meaningless — only the live `FileShare.None` hold signals "locked" (Phase 8).

## Open Questions (spec-level)

These are gaps in `aer-flow-behavioral-spec-v1.0.md` discovered during planning. Each should be resolved via a spec PR before the phase that first encounters it.

- ~~**`WorkflowTransition` event**~~ — resolved (#15): the event was removed from the spec; workflow-level status is a pure projection of step-level and pause/resume events (§5.2, §12).
- **Event Store performance** — full re-read vs. manifest-checkpoint-plus-tail (§21). Deferred until §20's no-daemon question is revisited.
- **Mutation Interface shape** — deliberately unspecified (§14); CLI is the reference implementation. Shape emerges from M7 implementation.

## Notes for future work

- **Worker adapter implementation (`Aer.Adapters`, no milestone yet)** — closed issue [#21](https://github.com/aer-works/aer-flow/issues/21) spiked a raw Claude→agy handoff and recorded facts that must inform whatever phase eventually builds the real Claude/Gemini adapters: each vendor needs a different scoped permission flag (no shared vocabulary), agy does not honor the invoking process's cwd and requires `--add-dir` plus absolute paths interpolated into the prompt text, and Claude needs stdin explicitly redirected to avoid a per-call stall. Read #21's findings before starting that work.
